## Feature Request: Implement a Responsive Navigation Bar

### Description
We need a responsive navigation bar for our application. The bar should include links to "Home," "About," "Services," and "Contact."

### Tasks
1. **Design the Navigation Bar:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to design a responsive navigation bar.
   - Include placeholder links for "Home", "About", "Services", and "Contact".

2. **Implement the Navigation Bar:**
   - Create a new React component for the navigation bar.
   - Ensure it is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.
   - Add meaningful comments when starting the navigation bar implementation.

3. **Integrate the Navigation Bar:**
   - Add the navigation bar component to the main layout of the application.

### Additional Notes
- **Branch:** Please create a new branch from `feature/website-theme` for your changes.
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/website-theme
  git pull origin feature/website-theme
  git checkout -b feature/create-navbar
   ```
- Pull Request: Submit a pull request to merge your changes into feature/website-theme.
- Testing: Ensure the navigation bar appears correctly on different screen sizes, and the 
    links work.
