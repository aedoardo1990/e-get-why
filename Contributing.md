## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use the following branches:

- `development`: Active development branch.
- `production`: Stable production branch.

### Current Feature Branches

We maintain feature branches for ongoing development of new features. Contributors are encouraged to work on these branches for specific features or create a new feature branch.

#### List of Feature Branches

- **User Registration and Authentication:**
  - `feature/user-authentication`
  - `feature/user-registration`
- **Story Submission:**
  - `feature/story-submission`
  - `feature/add-story`
- **Story Feed:**
  - `feature/story-feed`
  - `feature/story-list`
- **Upvote Feature:**
  - `feature/story-upvote`
  - `feature/add-upvote`
- **Categories for Stories:**
  - `feature/story-categories`
  - `feature/add-categories`
- **User Profile:**
  - `feature/user-profile`
  - `feature/profile-page`
- **Search Functionality:**

### Creating a New Feature or Fix

#### Working on a Feature Branch

To work on a feature branch, follow these steps:

1. **Switch to the Feature Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/new-feature-name
    git pull origin feature/new-feature-name
    ```

2. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or fix.
3. **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement part of new feature: description of changes"
    ```

4. **Push Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-feature-name
    ```

5. **Submit Pull Request:** Open a pull request to merge your changes back into the feature branch.

### Running Tests

Before submitting your changes, ensure all tests pass.

### Building the Project

Follow the setup instructions in the main README to build and run the project locally.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Pushing changes to the `development` branch triggers builds and deployments to the development environment. Pushing to the `production` branch triggers deployments to the production environment.

## Pull Requests

1. **Submit Pull Request:** Open a pull request to merge your feature branch into `development`.
2. **Review Process:** Your pull request will be reviewed by other contributors. Make necessary changes if requested.
3. **Merge:** Once approved, your pull request will be merged into `development`.
